# To-Do-Or-Not-To-Do
This is my assignment submission where I was tasked to create a simplistic page that contains notes to add information (figuratively speaking) to remind the end-client throughout the week. This site utilizes HTML and advanced CSS.

You can view the live site at the following URL: https://mjihaduddin00.github.io/To-Do-Or-Not-To-Do/

Thanks!
